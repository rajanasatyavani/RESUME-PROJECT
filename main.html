    <h3> PROJECT WORK (BTech Final Year)</h3>
    <p>Advanced Sentiment Analysis of Social Media for Trend Monitoring and Brand Management:<br>
        The primary objective of the Sentiment Analysis for Social Media project is to develop and implement an advanced sentiment analysis 
system that accurately assesses and categorizes the emotional tone expressed in social media content.<br> 
 A process that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze social media data to determine the emotions 
and opinions of the people posting. The goal is to understand how people feel about a brand, product, or service, and whether their 
comments are positive, negative or neutral. <br>
 Understanding customer opinions is crucial for businesses to improve products, identify competitors, and analyze trends. Social media 
provides valuable data for this purpose. The Sentiment Analysis for Social Media project leverages this data to extract insights and 
support business decisions.
